 -there need to be able to be users with different accounts and their own questions and database tables, etc.
 -favourite tags choice for user
 -print messages for certain things like when there are no more questions to answer or when a question is added or edited successfully
 -answer questions view->gives you options (by tags, by dates, etc.)
 -add view for answering a question and rating how well you know it?
 -also on homepage show how many questions need to be reviewed and how many are close to being twice as long (which would cause counter to remain the same)
 -finish reading the 7 step tutorial and integrating the way they do their views/urls into this app (since they initially show you a long way and then show you a very efficient way)
 -add test cases for functions, especially ones that update objects and deal with the main program logic
 -how can I keep updating my app while using it
 -cite where you got your information about memory retention from
 -make an info page describing how the app works and its logic (e.g. how the answering orders the questions in terms of percentage of its review date from oldest to newest, how the colours of the links signify when the question's review date is, etc.)

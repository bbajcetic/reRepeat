 -print messages for certain things like when there are no more questions to answer or when a question is added or edited successfully
 -finish reading the 7 step tutorial and integrating the way they do their views/urls into this app (since they initially show you a long way and then show you a very efficient way)
 -add test cases for functions, especially ones that update objects and deal with the main program logic
 -there need to be able to be users with different accounts and their own questions and database tables, etc.
 -answer questions view->gives you options (by tags, by dates, etc.)
 -favourite tags choice for user
 -how can I keep updating my app while using it
 -cite where you got your information about memory retention from

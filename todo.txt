 -allow users to skip questions
 -make question and answer text boxes bigger (maybe by changing the default django widgets for the type of model attribute to be a large text box instead)
 -print messages for certain things like when there are no more questions to answer or when a question is added or edited successfully
 -answer questions view->gives you options (by tags, by dates, etc.)
 -add view for answering a question and rating how well you know it
 -add tags when creating a question
 -allow users to answer questions that are almost ready (>=90% ready)
 -when in show_question view, don't label question with its id because its number is irrelevant and some numbers will be skipped if they are deleted (e.g. 3 questions, ids might be 1,2,and 4)
 -finish reading the 7 step tutorial and integrating the way they do their views/urls into this app (since they initially show you a long way and then show you a very efficient way)
 -add test cases for functions, especially ones that update objects and deal with the main program logic
